# Sequential Search

 In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.  
 For example: Linear Search.  
 
 Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.  
 
 ### How Linear Search Works?  
 
 The following steps are followed to search for an element k = 1 in the list below.

1.Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.
